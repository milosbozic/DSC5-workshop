# Data Science Conference 5.0 - workshop

18. November 2019.

## Lithology classification using Machine Learning

__Description__

Decision making in oil and gas production is based on geological and petrophysical data analysis. Traditional analysis of these data is expensive and time consuming, especially process of data collecting. This workshop will introduce the audience with the possibilities of using machine learning technologies for the reliable prediction of geological and petrophysical information based on wellbore data: geophysical well logs and core. We will take you through a complete path of building a classification model in Python. We will cover many key aspects of the model building process, including data cleaning, feature processing, model training, model validation, and prediction. In the end, we will talk about how to deploy models and use model predictions to make business decisions.

_Workshop presence requirements:_

* Basic Python knowledge required
* Basic knowledge of machine-learning theory 
* Desirable but not necessary knowledge of pandas, scikit-learn and matplotlib libraries.

Data used in this workshop are real well's log data from 25 wells from one __NIS__ oilfield (about 15832 examples in total) with four log variables:
* Gamma ray (GR)
* Resistivity (RT)
* Neutron porosity (CN)
* Density (ZDEN)

two descriptive variables:
* Well name
* Depth 

and lighology facies classes:
* Primary
* Secondary

Data are real but this is only one part of oilfield wells data and exactly well's names and descriptions are hidden.  

**NIS-GAZPROM is data owner and data can be used only for non-comercial purposes.**
